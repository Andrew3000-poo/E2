    Robert Frost: Nothing Gold Can Stay
    </h2>
<body>
  <p1 style="background-color: #FFD700; color: black">
  Nature’s first green is gold, <br>
Her hardest hue to hold. <br>
Her early leaf’s a flower; <br>
But only so an hour. <br>
Then leaf subsides to leaf. <br>
So Eden sank to grief, <br>
So dawn goes down to day. <br>
Nothing gold can stay. <br>
    </p1>

  Oscar Wilde: Symphony in Yellow
    </h3>

<p2 style="background-color: yellow; color: black">
An omnibus across the bridge<br>
Crawls like a yellow butterfly,<br>
And, here and there, a passer-by<br>
Shows like a little restless midge.<br>
<br>
Big barges full of yellow hay<br>
Are moored against the shadowy wharf,<br>
And, like a yellow silken scarf,<br>
The thick fog hangs along the quay.<br>
<br>
The yellow leaves begin to fade<br>
And flutter from the Temple elms,<br>
And at my feet the pale green Thames<br>
Lies like a rod of rippled jade.<br>
